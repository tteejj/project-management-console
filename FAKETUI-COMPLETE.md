### Data Persistence

All operations use PMC's standard data storage:
- **Get-PmcAllData** - Load tasks, projects, timelogs, focus
- **Save-PmcData** - Persist all changes with action logging
- **Update-PmcBlockedStatus** - Maintain dependency integrity

### Technical Architecture

**File:** `/home/teej/pmc/module/Pmc.Strict/FakeTUI/FakeTUI.ps1` (4345 lines)

**Classes:**
- `PmcVT100` - VT100 escape sequence helpers
- `PmcSimpleTerminal` - Terminal manipulation (singleton)
- `PmcStringCache` - Performance optimization for repeated strings
- `PmcStringBuilderPool` - Reusable StringBuilder instances
- `PmcMenuItem` - Menu item representation
- `PmcMenuSystem` - Menu bar and dropdown management
- `PmcCliAdapter` - Bridge to PMC CLI commands
- `PmcFakeTUIApp` - Main application controller

**View States:**
- `main` - Dashboard with task overview
- `tasklist` - Interactive task list
- `taskdetail` - Single task details
- `taskadd` / `taskedit` / `taskcomplete` / `taskdelete` / `taskimport` / `taskexport` - Task forms
- `projectlist` / `projectcreate` / `projectrename` / `projectarchive` / `projectdelete` / `projectstats` - Project management
- `timeadd` / `timelist` / `timeedit` / `timedelete` / `timereport` - Time tracking
- `timerstatus` - Timer display
- `todayview` / `tomorrowview` / `weekview` / `monthview` / `overdueview` / `upcomingview` / `blockedview` / `noduedateview` / `nextactionsview` / `kanbanview` / `burndownview` - Filtered views
- `focusset` / `focusstatus` - Focus management
- `depadd` / `depremove` / `depshow` / `depgraph` - Dependency management
- `filerestore` - Backup restoration
- `editundo` / `editredo` - Undo/redo operations

- `help` - Keybinding help

### Performance Features

- String caching for repeated rendering
- StringBuilder pooling to reduce allocations
- VT100 batching for screen updates
- Efficient task filtering and sorting

### Integration Points

FakeTUI integrates with all major PMC functions:
- `Get-PmcAllData` / `Save-PmcData` - Data layer
- `Start-PmcTimer` / `Stop-PmcTimer` / `Get-PmcTimerStatus` - Timer service
- `Update-PmcBlockedStatus` - Dependency system
- `New-PmcBackup` / `Clear-PmcBackups` - Backup management
- `Invoke-PmcUndo` / `Invoke-PmcRedo` - Undo/redo system
- `Start-PmcReview` / `Start-PmcProjectWizard` - Interactive tools
- `Get-PmcConfig` / `Get-PmcThemeList` / `Get-PmcAliasList` - Configuration
- `Show-PmcWeeklyTimeReport` - Reporting
- Full access to PMC's task, project, and time tracking data structures

### What's Intentionally CLI-Only

These features remain CLI-only by design:
- Advanced query engine (CLI query syntax is more powerful)
- Excel import/export (external tool interaction)
- Direct file editing (Edit-PmcConfig, Edit-PmcTheme)
- Bulk CSV operations (CLI is better for scripting)

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Interactive task list navigation** - Arrow keys to select tasks, Enter to view details
2. **In-place task editing** - Edit tasks directly from list view
3. **Color-coded priorities** - Visual priority indicators
4. **Progress bars** - For project completion percentages
5. **Calendar view** - Weekly/monthly task calendar
6. **Quick actions** - Single-key shortcuts for common operations

### Testing

The system is fully operational and ready for production use:

```bash
# Test with actual PMC data
./pmc.ps1

# Test CLI fallback
./pmc.ps1 -CLI

# All menu items work
# All forms persist data
# All views display correctly
# All integrations functional
```
