TASKLIST SCREEN
		subtasks not working - press s, nothing appears. probably a z index render issue as I can type and press enter and a subtask appears on screen. review that and also make sure the widgets will also render properly (date and project)
	 	space makes task name green. what is going on? what is it doing? 
		C does not complete the task. or nothing appears to happen to me
		Kanban Board is non-operational (this can wait until I ask to resolve it). 

PROJECTS MENU
	Can't access projectlist screen

TOOLS
	Theme editor not working. Themes are not switching. they are probably not updated to use the new theme system?
