# Honest Implementation Status

## What I KNOW Works (Backend Verified + Code Reviewed)

### File Menu
1. **Backup Data** ✅ - Backend exists, code reviewed, fixed recursion bug
2. **Restore Data** ✅ - Backend exists, code reviewed
3. **Clear Backups** ⚠️ - Backend exists but need to verify file deletion code
4. **Exit** ⚠️ - Sets running=false, should work but not tested

### Timer Functions
1. **Start Timer** ✅ - Calls Start-PmcTimer which exists in TimerService.ps1
2. **Stop Timer** ✅ - Calls Stop-PmcTimer which exists in TimerService.ps1
3. **Timer Status** ✅ - Calls Get-PmcTimerStatus which exists

### Undo/Redo
1. **Undo** ✅ - Calls Invoke-PmcUndo which exists in UndoRedo.ps1
2. **Redo** ✅ - Calls Invoke-PmcRedo which exists in UndoRedo.ps1

### Focus
1. **Clear Focus** ✅ - Calls Clear-PmcFocus which exists in FocusService.ps1

### Theme
1. **Theme Editor** ✅ - JUST FIXED - Now has interactive loop with proper selection

## What Needs Actual Testing

### Task Operations (Copy/Move/Priority/Postpone/Note)
- **Issue**: These manipulate task data directly using Get-PmcAllData/Save-PmcAllData
- **Risk**: Might have bugs in task ID lookups or data manipulation
- **Need**: Manual testing with actual task data

### View Operations (Agenda/Kanban/Tomorrow/Week/Month/etc)
- **Issue**: These query and display data
- **Risk**: Might have date calculation bugs or display issues
- **Need**: Manual testing to verify correct task filtering and display

### Pre-existing Operations
- All the operations that existed before (Add Task, List Tasks, etc.)
- **Assumption**: These work since they were already there
- **Risk**: Might have bugs I didn't catch

## The Real Problem

I built 42 TUI screens/forms but only verified:
- Backend functions exist (10 verified)
- Code compiles (yes)
- Code logic looks correct (mostly)

I did NOT verify:
- End-to-end functionality with real data
- Edge cases and error conditions
- User experience and workflow
- Whether forms actually submit correctly

## What User Wants

USER WANTS: Each feature COMPLETELY FINISHED before moving to next
- Not just "code exists"
- Not just "it compiles"
- But "it actually works and I tested it"

## Next Steps

Since I can't interactively test, I should:
1. Go through each implementation
2. Look for obvious bugs
3. Add better error handling
4. Make sure the code is bulletproof
5. Document any assumptions or known issues

This won't be "tested" but it will be "as complete as possible without interactive testing".
